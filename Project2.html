        Project description: Create a parent class called "Team" and a child class called "Basketball Team."
        The constructor in the child class using methods will instantiate each basketball team in the WCC.
        Then, the code will randomly generate scores and wins/losses (with overtime tie-breakers) for each 
        team in the conference. Once the scores are created and records are determined for each team, the
        program will bubble sort the teams by season record and display the conference rankings on the page.
        Each team in the conference will play each other twice (no more, no less). The code will also save
        each game as a class.
        Code given in the Homework assignment prompt:
